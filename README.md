## Welcome to my Portfolio!

Hello, and welcome to my react portfolio! As you navigate my page, you will see my home page, where you can learn more about me.

Next you will see my portfolio page, which shows my top projects that I've worked on so far. 

There you will find links to each of the live pages. Want to contact me? I have my contact page set up for you to email me any quesitions, concerns, or thoughts you have about my 

portfolio. You will also see links to my LinkedIn profile, as well as my GitHub profile. You will also see a tag for all my git repos. Click a link, and it will take you straight 

to its associated git repo! Take a look around, let me know what you think!
